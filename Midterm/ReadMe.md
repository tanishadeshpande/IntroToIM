# Campus Cat Chase: Midterm Project

The main premise of this game is that you play as a cat, and have to catch 30 rats in order to win. It is set on the highline of NYUAD, hence the name "campus cat". First, users are greeted with the following screen:

This explains the instructions, which is basically that you use the left and right keys to move the cat in order to catch the mice that are 
approaching you. Once the user clicks the spacebar, the following screen appears:

Here we can see that the rats are approaching, and there is a score tally at the top left corner of the screen -- this will keep increasing by 1 for every rat you catch, until you catch 30 rats at which point the game will end.

A preview of how the game goes is shown here:

When 30 rats are caught, the user is shown the following screen, and they can press the R key to restart.

If they choose to restart the game, the score will be reset to 0 and they will have to catch 30 rats again.
