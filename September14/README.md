# Assignment 2

## Creating my own artwork

For my artwork, I created the following optical illusion:

To create the function to change the colour, I used the keyPressed() function -- when the 'p' key is pressed, the colour scheme changes to the pink and purple one, and when the 'b' key is pressed it changes to the blue and green one.

I found this assignment harder than the previous one, mainly because this time I wanted to create something dynamic. Last time I had used the rotate() function, and through that I also learnt about the translate() function that I used this time. I think what I found the hardest was figuring out how to make the squares shorter for each iteration of the for() loop, which I later learnt I could use scale for, so in each iteration the square would be 0.9 times the size of the previous one. 

I also really enjoyed playing around with the keyPressed() function, as it allowed a lot more customisability.
