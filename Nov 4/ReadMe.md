# Assignment: Creative Switch

## Idea

It took me a while to think of an idea where I could make an on & off switch without using my hands. Then, one day while I sitting on a chair I realised 
that I had a habit of rocking my chair, and noticed that the chair's leg would intermittently touch the ground everytime I rocked the chair. This is where
I got my idea of making a switch that would turn on every time I rocked my chair and the leg touched the ground.
