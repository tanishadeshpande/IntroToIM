# Assignment: Creative Switch

## Idea

It took me a while to think of an idea where I could make an on & off switch without using my hands. Then, one day while I sitting on a chair I realised 
that I had a habit of rocking my chair, and noticed that the chair's leg would intermittently touch the ground everytime I rocked the chair. This is where
I got my idea of making a switch that would turn on every time I rocked my chair and the leg touched the ground.

## Process

I started by taping a piece of aluminium foil to the floor, and then wrapped one leg chair with aluminium foil. This was the basic setup for my switch, and then I began to make the circuit on my breadboard. I found this slightly difficult, but the existing circuit diagrams from what we had done in class really helped. I also had pictures from when we made the circuit with one switch and two LEDs, so that was what I made with two wires standing in for the switch.

Then, I modified the arduino code we had used in class to make it so that when the switch was on, the LED lights would alternate and blink at a quick pace. Then, as a test, I tried to see if the circuit would work if I held the two wires together and just touched them together. At first it wouldn't work, but then after I realised it was a simple error of putting my resistor in the wrong place, it finally worked! 

Finally, I had to bring the pieces together. I only had short wires, so that posed a bit of an issue. I resolved this by making a coil of aluminium foil on one wire, so that it acted as an extra conducter. Then I used zip ties to to fix the wire to the chair, and stuck the other wire of the circuit on the foil that was on the floor. This finally worked!
